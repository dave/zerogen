# Zerogen

Zerogen generates reset method for any structure, allowing to reuse it easily. It has been written to use sync.pool
without fear of tricky bugs as one field not properly reset before reuse.

Just run zerogen and be sure that the reset method will wipe clean your instanciated structure.

## Installation

```sh
go get github.com/mrsinham/zerogen
```

## Usage

With the following structure in the mystructure.go file :

```go
package mypackage

type mystructure struct {
        field1 int
        field2 string
}
```

if you run :

```sh
$ zerogen github.com/me/mypackage mystructure
```

you will have this output :

```go
// Code generated by github.com/mrsinham/zerogen. DO NOT EDIT.
package mypackage

func (m *mystructure) Reset() {
	m.field1 = 0
	m.field2 = ""
}
```

just add the -w flag to write it to mystructure_reset.go.
